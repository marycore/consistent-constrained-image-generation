"""
CLEVR domain: property/value vocabulary shared by eval_dataset_gen and finetune_dataset_gen,
reflecting what's actually in the CLEVR-CCIG scenes: 8 colors, 3 shapes, 2 sizes, 2 materials,
4 quadrant regions (labeled "r0".."r3", matching the region atoms already baked into the
rendered scene data).

eval_dataset_gen deliberately excludes "material" from its ASP constraint search space (see
eval_dataset_gen/domain.py) -- that's a one-sided override on top of this domain, not a second
independent copy of it.

A future domain (e.g. COCO) would live as a sibling module, e.g. src/common/domain_coco.py,
exposing the same PROPERTIES/DIRECTIONS shape; run.py's --domain flag picks which one is active.

"""
COCO domain: symbolic vocabulary shared by eval_dataset_gen and
finetune_dataset_gen.

Unlike CLEVR, COCO does not define geometric shapes or materials.
Objects are represented by COCO object categories together with
attributes such as color and coarse image region.

The module exposes the same interface as other domains
(PROPERTIES, DIRECTIONS, REGION_LAYOUT, system_prompt_text),
allowing run.py's --domain flag to switch between domains.
